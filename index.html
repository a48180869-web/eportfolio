      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently pursuing my studies at <strong>Graphic Era Hill University</strong>, where I continuously explore the art and science of technology. My passion lies in building and experimenting with code—I love transforming ideas into interactive digital experiences. I actively contribute to the open-source community, having worked with renowned projects like <strong>cBioPortal</strong> and <strong>Spring</strong>. For context, open-source is a collaborative model where software code is publicly accessible, allowing developers from around the world to contribute, learn, and improve together. My journey in this space has taught me not only technical skills but also the value of global cooperation. Outside of contributions, I engage in freelance web development—bringing ideas to life with clean, responsive, and user-centered design, often driven by modern frameworks and best practices. For me, code isn't just a skill; it's a creative outlet, a problem-solving tool, and a bridge to innovation.
